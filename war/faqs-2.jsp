							<h3 id="faq-1"  style="background-color:#DAF7A6 "><strong>Q.</strong> Why are vaccinations important?</h3>
							<p>Vaccinations protect your child against serious diseases by stimulating the immune system to create antibodies against certain bacteria or viruses.</p>
								
							<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

							<h3 id="faq-2"  style="background-color:#DAF7A6"><strong>Q.</strong> What diseases do vaccines protect against?

</h3>
							<p>Immunizing your baby with vaccines protects against serious diseases like measles, whooping cough, polio, meningococcal disease, tetanus, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, influenza, and more.</p>

							<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

							<h3 id="faq-3" style="background-color:#DAF7A6"><strong>Q.</strong> I don’t know anybody who has had these diseases. Why does my baby need these vaccines?</h3>
							<p>While a few of these diseases have virtually disappeared because of vaccination, outbreaks of measles and whooping cough still occur in the U.S. Even if some diseases do completely disappear in the U.S., they are common in other parts of the world and are just a plane ride away. If we stop vaccinating against these diseases, many more people will become infected. Vaccinating your child will keep him or her safe</p>

							<h3 id="faq-4" style="background-color:#DAF7A6"><strong>Q.</strong> How many times do I need to bring my baby in for vaccinations?</h3>
							<p>At least five visits are needed before age two, but the visits can be timed to coincide with well-child check-ups. Your baby should get the first vaccine (hepatitis B) at birth, while still in the hospital. Multiple visits during the first two years are necessary because there are 14 diseases your baby can be protected against, and most require two or more doses of vaccine for the best protection.</p>

							<h3 id="faq-5" style="background-color:#DAF7A6"><strong>Q.</strong>I'm an adult, how do I pay for vaccines?</h3>
							<p>Out-of-pocket immunization costs may vary depending on your insurance coverage. Check with your doctor or clinic and your health insurance plan to determine your costs. For Medicare beneficiaries, both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are paid for by Medicare Part B if your healthcare provider accepts the Medicare-approved payment. Shingles vaccine is covered under Medicare Part D.</p>

							<h3 id="faq-6" style="background-color:#DAF7A6"><strong>Q.</strong>Do vaccines have side effects?</h3>
							<p>Vaccines are among the safest medicines available. Some common side effects are a sore arm or fever. There is a very small risk that a serious problems could occur after getting a vaccine. However, the potential risks from the diseases vaccines prevent are much greater than the potential risks associated with the vaccines themselves.</p>

							<h3 id="faq-7" style="background-color:#DAF7A6"><strong>Q.</strong>Are vaccines safe?</h3>
							<p>Vaccines are generally safe. The protection provided by vaccines far outweighs the very small risk of serious problems. Vaccines have made many serious childhood diseases rare today. Talk to your family doctor if you have any questions.</p>

							<div class="divider divider-right"><a href="#" data-scrollto="#faqs-list"><i class="icon-chevron-up"></i></a></div>

							<h3 id="faq-8" style="background-color:#DAF7A6"><strong>Q.</strong> Are there any reasons my child should not be vaccinated?</h3>
							<p>In special situations, children shouldn’t be vaccinated. For example, some vaccines shouldn’t be given to children who have certain types of cancer or certain diseases, or who are taking drugs that lower the body’s ability to resist infection.

If your child has had a serious reaction to the first shot in a series of shots, your family doctor will probably talk with you about the pros and cons of giving him or her the rest of the shots in the series.

							<h3 id="faq-8" style="background-color:#DAF7A6"><strong>Q.</strong> What if your child misses a vaccination? </h3>
							<p>If you have missed some scheduled vaccinations, your child may be unprotected until he gets all the vaccinations he has missed. It is safe to give him the vaccinations as soon as possible. 

Your paediatrician may also be able to recommend combination vaccines that provide immunity against several diseases in a single shot. 

Keeping a record of your child's immunisation may help you keep track of the vaccination due dates and the relevant time period between vaccines. Also this record is important for admission into a school. 

Use our vaccination scheduler to help you to see when your baby will be offered his vaccinations.
